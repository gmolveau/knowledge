# Python Exceptions

Look Before You Leap (LBYL) and Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission (EAFP)

## Try Except Else

the code in the `else` block is executed only if the code in the `try` block didn't throw an exception.

Another use of `else` is when code in the `try` block requires some cleanup (and doesn't have a usable `context manager`)
