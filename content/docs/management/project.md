# Project Management

states
------

use only TODO / DOING / DONE 
if another one is needed, make sure it is REALLY needed

queue
-----

Every team must have a single ordered queue of tasks

1. If there is downtime, it’s the top priority of everyone affected
2. If there is an incident, it’s the top priority for an on-call agent
3. My deployed issue waiting for my verification
4. Reviewed pull request waiting for deployment
5. My pull request with completed code review that requested changes
6. Outstanding pull request waiting for code review
7. Customer escalation received through email. For valid ones, create incident 
and delegate to on-call. For invalid ones, reply, apologize and provide customer support link
8. Top issue in the sprint backlogs
9. Any issue in the “when engineers have time” backlog

tasks
-----

Assign to a single person4. If you don’t know who that is, there should be 
no owner and there should be a clearly assigned person 
(we used current oncall agent) to process them and assign accordingly.

There is no absolute priority of an issue, only a relative priority to other issues.

here needs to be a separate system for handling questions 
for the development team from the rest of the company
